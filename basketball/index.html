    </ul>
    <p>The team calendars have been updated with these dates and times.  Please let me know if you have any questions about pictures.</p>
    <h2>November 17, 2014 - Game Schedule</h2>
    <p>Rockwood has released the game schedules for the league. I have updated the calendars for both teams to reflect our games. You can import the calendars to your personal calendar application
    (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) via iCal using the following URLs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5th Grade Calendar - <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/ojpt47t50equ4b3audmj7q3b74%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/ojpt47t50equ4b3audmj7q3b74%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics</a></li>
        <li>8th Grade Calendar - <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/85ej5gcqpb8t4ttdiprs34t7hc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/85ej5gcqpb8t4ttdiprs34t7hc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will update the calendars as changes occur, however you can also view the <a href="http://www.teamsideline.com/Org/Home.aspx?d=weFTGnx9npzf%2fm3HnKJ6uw%3d%3d">Rockwood League Schedules</a>
    directly if you have any questions.</p>
    <h2>October 23, 2014 - Welcome, Wolves!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to a new year of Wolves basketball.  I am proud to say that both teams have almost identical rosters from last year.  I am very happy to have everyone back for another season,
    and look forward to working with you all again this year.  There have been some rules changes, as well as some procedural changes for this season.  I will go over all of these in our first
    practice.</p>
    <p>The team calendars can be found with the links in the menu on the top of the page.  Practices times are on there now, however we won't have a game schedule for a few weeks.
    We have a less-than-optimal set of practice slots, with practices on Friday evenings and good number of blackout dates.  I will, however, be attempting to fill some of the blackout dates
    with practices at other venues where possible. Practices start on November 7th and will be held at Babler Elementary.  The 5th grade team will practice from 6:15-7:30, and the 8th grade
    team will practice from 7:45-9.</p>
    <p>Welcome back, and I cannot wait to see you all on the court!</p>
